1. Say two places by voice and let the robot go 
to these two places in turn to sweep.

3. Battery monitoring and back to the charging 
station.

Intelligent Floor Sweeping Robot
This project involves the design and development of an autonomous floor sweeping robot powered by ROS (Robot Operating System). The robot is capable of performing voice-controlled navigation, full-coverage path cleaning, battery monitoring, and autonomous recharging. It is suitable for both residential and commercial cleaning applications.

Key Features
Voice Control: Users can speak the names of two rooms, and the robot will sweep them in sequence.

Full-Coverage Cleaning: Optimized path planning using BÃ©zier curves ensures that the robot covers the entire area without missing any spots.

Low Battery Return: When battery drops below 30%, the robot sends an email to the user and returns to the charging station automatically.

Autonomous Mapping & Navigation: The robot can navigate and avoid obstacles based on live map generation.

Email Feedback: Battery status is communicated to the user via email for monitoring.

System Architecture
PathPlanningNode: The core ROS node that manages overall path planning.

CoveragePathPlanner: Generates complete coverage paths based on input maps.

BezierTrajectoryGeneratorWaypoint: Optimizes and smooths the path for better motion control.

FreeSpaceCalculator: Determines navigable space to ensure feasibility of planned paths.
